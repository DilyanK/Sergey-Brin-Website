<p>As Sergey Brin's interests were always data mining, information retrieval and the Interenet as a whole so his contributions are largely focused in those fields. At the time of the beginning of his career those distinct areas were not much looked into and the methods used to perform different operations were not productive. He has published a handful of academic papers on extracting patterns, dynamic data mining and lots of other techniques for information extraction from the World Wide Web. Some of them just demonstrate techniques for completing specific tasks but most of these writings introduce much smarter and efficient way of doing them. For example, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a931/81b4ad6b51d9f34555646867204c4c429531.pdf">Dynamic Data Mining: A New Architecture for Data with High Dimensionality"</a>, written by himself and Larry Page, depicts a whole new architecture for data mining.</p>

<p>Apart from that, he helped the growth of Internet immensely by developing his university project into a worldwide used search engine which leads to millions of people using the Internet to find anything they are looking for. After Google becomes extremely popular, Brin starts being invited as a featured speaker at numerous events and forums, some of them being international - "World Economic Forum and the Technology", "Entertainment and Design Conference". There he shares his point of view on the technology industry and the importance of research and improving.
