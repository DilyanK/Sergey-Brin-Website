<p>Google might be considered as one of the essentials of the Internet thus it is more relevant than ever. With more than 40 000 searches per second, adding up to just about 4 billion per day, it is the most visited website on the Internet. It is so widely used that a verb to "google" something has "settled" in our everyday speech - achievement that few websites can be proud with. The easiness with which the site operates, the functionality, the simplicity is what drives more and more people to Google and what makes it much more relevant than any other search engine on the Web. The accuracy of the search results is also a big influence for people to use Google. You can look up images, you can search by images, videos, news, you can check out places with little to no effort.</p>
<br />
<p>An important ingredient in Google's progress is that any website is searchable within it's search engine. With the advancing of websites, most of them implemented some kind of search system for their own domains but it's either non-efficient or simply not looking good enough. For example, even if you misspell a word Google will correct you and suggest the results which it thinks you wanted and in 99% of the situations it is correct. That makes it easier to add the name of a site to any search in Google to get the result from that certain domain. It also offers "search operators" which can get you the most of any search. You can search for exact phrases, you can exclude a search term, you can look up news from a specific location and many other options.
<br />
<br />
<p>Another huge factor is that nowadays Google is not only a search engine but also features an e-mail service(<a href="https://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>) and although not very popular - a social network(<a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a>). <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>(web browser), <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/">Google Maps</a> and <a href="https://earth.google.co.uk/">Google Earth</a>(exploring the world from your computer), Android(mobile operating system), AdSense and AdMob(earns you money from ads) are all services that are started, developed and owned by Google Inc. which help the search engine itself gain as much publicity as it can. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, bought by Google in 2006, is the second most visited website on the Internet and also largely contributes to Google's success bringing hundreds of millions of visitors every year.</p>
<br />
<p>Everything mentioned until now reinforces the opinion that Google is the most popular, most used and most relevant website up-to-date. And as we seen by it's rapid and steady rise, starting with less than 400 billion searches in 2007 to more than 1.2 trillion in 2012, it's here to stay.</p>
