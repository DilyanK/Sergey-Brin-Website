Himself and his university friend <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a> founded the infamous search engine Google.

<!--<center><h3>Parents</h3></center>-->
<p>His parents being Jewish were continually confronted by people with masked anti-Semitism beliefs and thus, his father was not allowed to study physics at any university he applied to due to the Communist Party's ban on Jews seeking higher education in particular subjects. Instead, Sergey Brin's father chose to study mathematics at the Moscow State University where he got a degree with honors. Later, extending his studies in mathematics he successfully defends his thesis to obtain a Doctorate degree at The University of Kharkiv. His mother also was a student of the Moscow State University and majored in mathematics and mechanics which gave her the job in a research laboratory. His parents realised that sooner or later Sergey is going to be restrained of full development thus not giving him enough opportunities. This lead to the decision for the family to apply for a visa and a year later they immigrated to the USA.</p>

<!--<center><h3>Scdhool years</h3></center>-->
<p>Sergey's first school was Mishkan Torah Hebrew School, where he was bullied because of his strong accent and was later moved to the elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland. His parents became friends with Patty Barshay, the school's director and she characterizes Sergey as "outgoing, self-confident, and fascinated by numbers and mathematics."<span>[1]</span> He believes that studying there was central to his success. Just at the age of 15 he becomes an university student and at 19 graduates with a doubled bachelorâ€™s degree in computer systems and mathematics with honors, which earns him a scholarship of National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, covering his afterward studies at Stanford University, "the most prestigious high-tech university of the United States"<span>[2]</span>. There he met Larry Page after both being assigned to the same campus. At first they argued on any topic but after realising that they are sharing the same interests became friends. Following an university research project on improving the ways of finding information on the Internet, on September 7, 1998 after pausing their studies they founded Google Inc. where Larry was the CEO and Sergey the President. It is currently the largest search engine in the world.</p>
